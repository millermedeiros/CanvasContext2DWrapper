jslint for java <http://code.google.com/p/jslint4java/>
=======================================================

This is a java wrapper around the fabulous tool by Douglas Crockford, jslint
(See <http://jslint.com/>). It provides a simple interface for detecting
potential problems in JavaScript code.

You can run it on the command line:

  % java -jar jslint4java-1.3.3.jar application.js
  jslint:application.js:11:9:Line breaking error ')'.
  jslint:application.js:11:10:Missing semicolon.

There are a multitude of options; try "--help" for more details.

The output is colon separated fields.  The fields are:

* "jslint"
* the file name
* the line number (starting at zero)
* the character number (starting at zero)
* the problem that was found

You may also use the jar as an ant task.  The quickest way to get started is
to drop it in ~/.ant/lib.  See docs/ant.html for more details.

NB: The packaged jar file includes a builtin version of rhino (a JavaScript
engine).  If this causes trouble, you may wish to download standalone versions
through the maven repository.

If you wish to use jslint4java from within Java, please use a maven dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.googlecode.jslint4java</groupId>
      <artifactId>jslint4java</artifactId>
      <version>1.3.3</version>
    </dependency>
